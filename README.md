DAY 1 TASK


1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing. 
HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster.

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?
In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties.A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
